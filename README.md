====================

jQuery Enabled Website

This site has been put together as a template for a professional portfolio site. 
It was created using a Twitter Bootstrap template downloaded from http://initializr.com. 
The site contains a Flickr API feed to create the Las Vegas Strip background photos from public feeds. 
It also implements the jQuery form validation and jQuery UI tabs widget. 
The home page uses the HTML5 localStorage API to store and display project information.
